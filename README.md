## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As an aspiring DevOps professional, I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and leadership experience in collaborative and innovative environments.

With a strong foundation in Linux shell scripting, CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, Ansible and Terraform. I aim to contribute to forward-thinking organizations where I can make a meaningful impact.
